    "## NLP As A Supervised Problem\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Supervised NLP requires a pre-labelled dataset for training and testing, and is generally interested in categorizing text in various ways. In this case, we are going to try to predict whether a sentence comes from Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll or Persuasion by Jane Austen, using different supervised learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our feature-generation approach will be something called BoW, or Bag of Words. BoW is quite simple: For each sentence, we count how many times each word appears. We will then use those counts as features."
